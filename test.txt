I have been working on IPE Project for the past 1.5 years and have learned extensively about each aspect 
of the project. I would like to express my gratitude for being part of the team.
I have worked hard & extensively to release product on time.
I believe I have learned well from project and required skills and am ready to take next role.  

Iâ€™m writing this mail to request for promotion to the position of AST. 
A promotion at this time would be a great motivator for me,
as I would feel that my contribution was recognized as valuable. 
The details of my contribution are in the enclosed Excel attachements.

I am hoping for a positive response from you.
I would be happy to discuss my request with you at a time of your convenience.


Thank you for considering my request.
